# EcommerceWebsite by Emily Li
This is my project I've been working on the past week. It is a ecommerce website, and I decided to make one selling games, since it is my interest. 
This is my first project, so it is not perfect. But I am pretty proud of it. I had help from google and other resources to make this project. 
The website should have a home page, product page, login in page, registration page, and a checkout page. 
Although the buttons are not functioning, the layout and design is done.
And I think I learned a lot from making this. One piece that I am very proud of is my Product page. At first, flexbox was intimidating and I was confused.
But eventually I had help and figured it out. I really like how it looks.
